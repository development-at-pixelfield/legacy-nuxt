    discoverDesc: `Following the auction of Beeple's NFT-based work of art at Christie's,
          which eventually sold for $69.3 million with fees, the NFTs as a model
          of ownership seem to have been particularly attractive to
          up-and-coming artists. With fewer barriers than the traditional art
          market, it becomes easier to get your name out there, and earn some
          (serious) money too. Even blue chip artists like Damien Hirst are
          jumping on the NFT bandwagon.`,
